## âœ¨ Key Features
This platform is built with a focus on usability, security, and efficiency, encompassing the following core features:

MERN Stack Foundation: Built on a robust and scalable architecture using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.

Role-Based Secure Dashboards: Implements distinct, private dashboards for Organizers and Participants with segregated functionality.

JWT Authentication: Utilizes JSON Web Tokens (JWT), stored in Local Storage, to secure routes and manage session persistence without redirecting users on reload.

Advanced Data Handling: All data fetching (GET requests) is managed using TanStack Query for efficient caching, synchronization, and state management.

Comprehensive Camp Management (Organizer): Organizers can effortlessly Add, View, Update, and Delete camp details.

Secure Payment Gateway: Features Stripe integration for secure processing of camp fees, updating payment status on success.

Dynamic Filtering & Sorting: The Available Camps page supports searching, and sorting by criteria like Most Registered, Camp Fees, and Camp Name.

Participant Analytics: Participants get a dedicated dashboard route with Recharts-based analytics visualizing their registered camp history.

Feedback & Ratings System: Participants can provide feedback and ratings post-payment, which is then displayed prominently on the homepage.

Custom Alert System: Provides a smooth user experience with Sweet Alerts/Toasts for all CRUD operations and successful authentication, replacing default browser alerts.

Responsive Design: Ensures a seamless experience across all devices (mobile, tablet, and desktop) with a fully responsive layout, including the dashboards.

Environment Variable Security: Sensitive credentials (Firebase config, MongoDB URI) are securely hidden using Environment Variables.
